extension to save and retrieve tabs.

Idea: Save a workspace. All tabs in a current window can be saved as a 'working project'. The tabs can then be retrieved  subsequently (maybe months later), to pull up all relevant tabs.

Done:
* created hello world extension - popup
* retrieved all current open tabs and displayed in popup
* retrieved bookmarks and displayed in popup
* enabled displayed bookmarks or tabs to be opened in a new window
* search works (case sensitive)
* saves all tabs to a user defined workspace
* able to retrieve list from workspace, and redisplay in popup
* retrieve all workspaces and display in dropdown
* reopen all tabs rather than just display in popup
* rather than open in current window, open a new window?
* load a single page to see all workspaces
* need ability to delete workspaces
* when opening, put first one in existing tab
* dialog not disappearing after selecting yes
* date (or last saved date?)
* added feedback link
* added background.js with uninstall callback to feedback
* added .css 


imagine a 'delicious' or 'instapaper' like site for your projects.

To Do
* prevent overwrite of workspace! first just deny, then think through how overwrite should work.
* select all from drop down
* change search to search extension lists?
* show all workspaces in a starter tab
* Easier way to overwrite an existing workspace
* Create history of workspaces (for how long?)
